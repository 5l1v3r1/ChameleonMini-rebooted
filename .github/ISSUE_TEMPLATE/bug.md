## Context
### Prerequisites
<!-- Put an "X" for each item you achieved or agree with, between [ ], like this: [X]. If you do not know, do not check. You are most probably not ready to submit a bug report if not all items are checked, or the bug report should not be submitted on this repository: if you do so anyway, you may receive no feedback. -->
* [ ] I can reproduce the issue/bug that I report on
* [ ] I run the latest version of the firmware from this repository
* [ ] I am available to provide further details, and can reproduce the same initial situation where I identified the issue
* [ ] I checked all available open sources, like Wiki, Internet search engines, and other issues, to document what I found in the better possible extent, confirm that something did not function as expected, and that a bug fix is required in this repository code
* [ ] I checked for issues here, and did not find this one was already reported on
* [ ] I understand this repository or issue tracker is not a support service for the hardware I bought, but a cooperative open-source project to play with it, and that nobody here is affiliated with ChameleonMini manufacturers or sellers
### Environment
